This is a working solution to the Problem Set Reverse from Harvard's CS50x course:

This is for skill showcase and eductional purposes only. 
Students taking CS50, I stronlgy encourage you to attempt your own code and use this as inspiration 
only. Keep in mind the Academic Honesty Policy!

This is a C programming file that will take a .wav file as input and will reverse the audio of that file. In doing so it will take user input from the CLI, asking to run the program while
prompting for a name of the input file and a name for the new file. It checks the correct amount of Command Line Arguments, an input file of the correct WAV File Format, 
reads this from the back and writes into a new file.

For it to work, you will need to create a directory with the .c file, the file wav.h and an existing .wav file. (And of course a working compiler for C/C++)
