This is a C programming file that will take a .wav file as input and will reverse the audio of that file. In doing so it will take user input from the CLI, asking to run the program while
prompting for a name of the input file and a name for the new file. It checks the correct amount of Command Line Arguments, an input file of the correct WAV File Format, 
reads this from the back and writes into a new file.
